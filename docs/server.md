# Pritt Server API

## Accessing the API
There will be three main ways you would interact with the Pritt Server API

1. The Pritt CLI
2. The Pritt Website
3. Directly from the API

### The Pritt API
The only public API available for Pritt is the direct API used by the Pritt CLI and website. The OpenAPI description for the API can be found [here]().

## Development
Code for the server is located at the `server/` directory.

If you want to make changes or contributions to anything related to the OpenAPI definition of the server, you might want to check the [schema directory instead](../schema).
