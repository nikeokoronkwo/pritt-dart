# The Pritt Configuration File

## Schema

- `private`: Whether this package is private or not.
- `contributors`: Either specify a list of contributors by name or create an `AUTHORS` file at the root of the project

<!-- Some notes
1. You cannot change publicity of a package in future versions unless you explicitly set it to `false` in the site.
